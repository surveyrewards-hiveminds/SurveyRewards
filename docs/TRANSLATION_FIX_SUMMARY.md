# Translation Auto-Checkbox Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

When users checked individual auto-translation checkboxes for secondary languages (survey title, description, question text, or informational text), the system was immediately calling the Google Translate API instead of just saving the state.

## Root Cause

The `handleAutoTranslationToggle` function in `SurveyBuilder.tsx` was calling the `translate()` function immediately when a checkbox was toggled to "checked" state.

## Solution

Modified `handleAutoTranslationToggle` function to:

1. **ONLY save the translation state** (auto/manual mode)
2. **NOT call the Google Translate API** when checkbox is toggled
3. **Preserve existing translation values** when changing modes
4. **Only perform actual translation during `handleConfirmedTranslation`** (after payment)

## Key Changes

- Removed the immediate `translate()` call from `handleAutoTranslationToggle`
- Added proper state preservation when enabling/disabling auto-translation
- Clear separation between "marking for translation" vs "actual translation execution"

## Behavior After Fix

✅ **Correct**: Checking auto-translation checkbox → saves state only  
✅ **Correct**: Translation happens only after payment confirmation  
✅ **Correct**: Existing translation values are preserved when toggling modes  
✅ **Correct**: Global auto-translation checkbox works correctly (was already correct)

## Files Modified

- `src/components/survey/builder/SurveyBuilder.tsx` - Fixed `handleAutoTranslationToggle` function

## Testing

- Build passes successfully
- No compilation errors
- Logic verified for proper state management without API calls
